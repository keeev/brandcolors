Brandcolors (LESS & Sass Variables)
===========

LESS and SASS variables for all known brands. Inspired by [Brandcolors](http://brandcolors.net/) and
some selfbuilt buttons in a sideproject a few days ago I thought it would be useful to have some brandcolors
as variable for LESS and Sass in every project I need them.

Just import them via:

 ```css
@import ("brandcolors.less");
 ```

if you use less or **.sass** if you use Sass (obviously, ha?). If you're looking for a way to organize your Sass/LESS checkout [Organize that Sass!](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/organize-that-sass) on A List Apart.
