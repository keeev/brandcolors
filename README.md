Brandcolors (LESS & Sass Variables)
===========

LESS and SASS variables for all known brands. Inspired by [Brandcolors](http://brandcolors.net/) and 
some selfbuilt buttons in a sideproject a few days ago I thought it would be useful to have some brandcolors
as variable for LESS and Sass in every project I need them. 

Just import them via: 

 ```css 
@import (brandcolors.less)
 ```
 
if you use less or **.sass** if you use Sass (obviously, ha?). If you're looking for a way to organize your Sass/LESS checkout [Organize that Sass!](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/organize-that-sass) on A List Apart.

Currently there are the following services/brands: 

* Github
* Facebook
* Dropbox
* Dribbble
* Twitter
